# Easy-Sudoku
Sudoku solver

This project basically asks the user to input an incomplete sudoku puzzle and the completely solved grid is given. This is implemented with the help of basic data structures like 1D and 2D arrays and algorithms like recursion and backtracking. Work is going on to make the user interface of the project.
